# Hands-on with ML serving pipelines

## Real-time serving with embedded model

**Real-time serving with embedded model** is about distributed event-at-a-time processing with millisecond latency and high throughput.

**What to optimize**: latency and throughput

**End user**: usually no direct interactions with a model

**Validation**: offline and online via A/B testing
